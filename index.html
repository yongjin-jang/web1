<h2> Steave Jobs 1995</h2>
<p>Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you
<b><u>how to think</u></b>.</p>

<p>1995 was a time when computers already played an important role in our society but weren’t as omnipresent in our lives as they are today.</p>
<p style="margin-top:50px;">1995 was a time when programming was a field for a very tiny subset of the population, and the only children who ever learnt it were an even tinier subset.</p>
<p>1995 was the year when Steve Jobs was approaching the end of his exile from Apple after being kicked out of the company a decade earlier. Him as his new company, NeXT, were brought back in to save Apple from near bankruptcy. Incidentally NeXT was all about using Object-Oriented Programming as the basis for operating systems and went on to become the backbone for today’s Mac operating system.</p>
